# clock angle

## The method

The method `clock_angle?()` is defined for the string class. Given a certain time, determines the distance between the minute and hour hands on an analog clock. For example, 12:20 would return 120ยบ and 6:00 would return 180ยบ. The format for the input string must be `'hh:mm'` for this method to work correctly.
